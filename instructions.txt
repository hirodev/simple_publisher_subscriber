Test 2. Multi Power Point
A power switch is required that can turn on or off any number of appliances. An appliance is, for example, a Blender, a Toaster, or an Oven.
 
Other programmers have already written those appliances and you can't change their source code.  For example, you cannot require them all to implement a particular interface. 
Fortunately, each such appliance already has two methods to turn its particular appliance on and off. 
Unfortunately, all such methods were written by different people and have different names (e.g. Blender.swizzle(), Toaster.startToasting(), Oven.heatUp()).

-Write three third party appliances and put them in a separate package. It should be visible from the output of each appliance whether it is turned on or off (in its third party vocabulary).
-Make a representation of a multi-power point. You can plug in as many appliances as you wish and turn them on and off all at once, by turning the multi-power point on() and off().
